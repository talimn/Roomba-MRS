Integration between pathfinding and control systems: commands can be sent to the Roomba through Unity. Will work with these commands in next lab time.
Unity UI direction buttons have been completed. Still plan to make necessary adjustments based on needs of project throughout semester. 
Only one Roomba can be selected for manual control at a time, so there will not be any overwritten commands in simulation.
Plan to integrate localization and pathfinding subsystem over upcoming week.
