Taylor: Currently designing UI in Unity. Design will consist of buttons sending directional commands to the Roombas and two selector buttons to choose between which 
Roomba to manually control. An override button will permit user to assume manual control over movement of Roombas and an indicator will show the override status.
Plan to include console output at the the bottom of the UI as well.
Two scenes will be run simultaneously, one for running the pathfinding and the other for observing movement in real life. Scenes run separately and the pathfinding
scripts are separate. Each Roomba currently has its own point-to-point pathfinding script.
