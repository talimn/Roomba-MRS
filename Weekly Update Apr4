Roomba can now smoothly transition between override mode and automatic mode. Roomba will begin
moving according to pathing script and entering override mode will immediately cease movement. 
Current time since startup is displayed on the screen during operation. Roomba can follow series of
commands without stopping and the current time determines what command will be sent to the Roomba (for testing purposes).
Once Roomba finishes path, it will stop. It can still enter and exit override mode at this point.
