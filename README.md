# Roomba-MRS
ECEN 403/404 Senior Design Project: Team #41

Description: The code and validation material for the design and integration of the Roomba Multi-Robot System can be found in this repository.

With the use of Unity Game Engine the A* pathfinding algorithm will be tested for use with two or more iRobot Roomba vacuum cleaners.
The goal of the algorithm is to find the most efficient path from one point to another while avoiding any obstacles. This process continues until all space is covered.
Roombas will adapt to any changes in environment by recalculating their paths and navigating around all objects, including each other.
Pathfinding has successfully been tested in the simulation subsystem in ECEN 403.

A video of the final project operating in it's various modes is available at the following link:
