HOW CAN I ADD A ROOMBA TO MY GAME???

1- Drag the prefabs located in the Prefabs folder into the scene

2- Go to Window/Package Manager and install PostProcessing package

3- Put all the waypoints into the waypoints list of  roombaScript

4- Create a empty gameobject, drag it to StopPosition variable, place it where you want, it is the stop position

5- Add rigidbody, a navMesh agent and a collider to the roomba, deactivate gravity option of the rigidbody and configure the navMeshAgent

6- Open the Navigation window, set your roomba nav mesh parameters and press bake

You can not have free control of the Roomba in mobile version, but you can see the artificial intelligence working

Important[if the post processing is not working, you have to delete the camera of the roomba model and create a new one]
