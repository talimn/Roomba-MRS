Taylor: Completed UI design in game view of Unity simulation. Console view is full operational and multiple commands can be entered in so that the console will give
information about the system. If user enters 'reload', game will reinitialize and Roombas will return to starting point. If user enters 'location', the 3D coordinates
of each Roomba will be displayed in the console view.
Still need to add scripts to direction buttons and override toggle to have complete functionality. Currently working with James to connect ESP32 to Unity project via
bluetooth. The bluetooth connection between my computer and the ESP32 is successful but still need to connect to Unity using the bluetooth package imported into project.
