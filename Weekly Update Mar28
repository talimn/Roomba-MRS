Pathfinding: Script for algorithm on testing has been written. This is a very basic test script which will be simply used for testing purposes and then built upon
until the full algorithm is working properly on the Roomba. The beginning test will be a highly controlled path (series of directions) that the Roomba will follow.
The path will be adjusted to include more complicated instructions such as more frequent turns for other beginning tests.
