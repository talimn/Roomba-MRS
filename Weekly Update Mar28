Pathfinding: Script for algorithm on testing has been written. This is a very basic test script which will be simply used for testing purposes and then built upon
until the full algorithm is working properly on the Roomba. The beginning test will be a highly controlled path (series of directions) that the Roomba will follow.
The path will be adjusted to include more complicated instructions such as more frequent turns for other beginning tests.

Controls: Breadboarded out a prototype of 5 sensor obstacle avoidance, unfortunately does not work on the PCB yet. Several GPIO pins were soldered together to
create proper output connections for the mux, but the mux was still not working properly. It could be a soldering issue on the mux, as the mux is very small and
hard to solder. Currently working on debugging further, creating a new pcb design for the mux used in the breadboard prototype, and implementing the bumper sensor 
into the final control firmware.
