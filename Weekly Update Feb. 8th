James:
-PCB:
      Due to weather, the UPS package was delayed. The PCB arrived in the mail last night (Tueasday 2/7). 
      Now that I have the PCB and components, I can begin assembling the board.
-Firmware:
      I updated the Roomba control firmware to use five distance sensors instead of one. Also ensured
      that Roomba is properly working and ready for pathfinding integration.
-Mounting:
      I started using and learning Autocad so that a mounting system for the PCB, sensors, and 
      localization modules can be designed.
