Algorithm fixes: 
- When target point is out of range (x-z coordinates that are not on plane), path to coordinates will still be calculated.
When Roomba reaches wall or barrier in attempt to approach this point, it will stop movement completely to indicate invalid coordinates. 
- Previous unexplained error of game objects skipping coordinates or beginning recalculation of path to next coordinate before fully completing current path.
The difference in distance between target point and current point was tested with different values to find an ideal range that could prevent this from happening.
When plane was scaled to larger dimensions, the pathing calculation errors were reduced.
- If target point is directly on the other side of an obstacle, Roomba no longer slows down to an extremely low speed as it travels around the obstacle's edge. 
Speed may be reduced depending on obstacle size or movement but only by a small amount.
General:
- All code updated and transferred to a new Unity project to be committed to Github. Unity has been linked to Github account but there are current issues with
committing all the files to the Roomba-MRS repository. This issue should be fixed this week.
- Plan to create a UI for current Unity setup so that same files may be used and necessary changes can be easily made.
